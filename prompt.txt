Create a space travel booking platform called "Dubai Stellar Gateway" that positions Dubai as the global hub for commercial space tourism. The platform should balance futuristic design with practical functionality.

CORE REQUIREMENTS:

Develop a responsive, modern React/Next.js application with:

Clean, component-based architecture
Intuitive navigation across all device types
Space-themed UI with a luxury Dubai aesthetic
Implement these key functional modules:

a) TRIP SCHEDULING & BOOKING:

Interactive solar system map for destination selection
Calendar with real astronomical events affecting travel
Seat class visualization (luxury, business, economy)
Multi-step booking wizard with clear progress tracking
b) PRICING & PACKAGES:

Dynamic pricing based on destination, date, and seat class
Package creator (combining accommodations, experiences)
VIP zero-gravity experiences with virtual previews
Loyalty/points system for frequent space travelers
c) ACCOMMODATION RECOMMENDATIONS:

AI-powered preference matching for lodging options
3D virtual tours of space hotels and orbital stations
Amenity filters (gravity levels, viewing ports, activities)
Reviews from "previous travelers" with satisfaction metrics
d) USER DASHBOARD:

Mission control-style interface for managing bookings
Real-time countdown timers for upcoming launches
Personalized travel preparation guides and checklists
Interactive space weather and orbital conditions display
TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:

Frontend: React/Next.js with Tailwind CSS
State management: Redux or Context API
Animation: Framer Motion for smooth space-themed transitions
Mock API: JSON Server or similar to simulate backend functionality
3D elements: Three.js for immersive space visualization
UNIQUE FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:

"Gravity Simulator" showing how different conditions feel
"Space Window" live feed showing current views from orbit
AR feature to preview space hotel rooms in your current location
Digital space passport that collects stamps from destinations
The design should incorporate Dubai's luxury aesthetic while maintaining a scientifically plausible space travel experience. All code should be well-documented, utilize modern best practices, and be optimized for performance
